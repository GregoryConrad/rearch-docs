# Actions
Actions (sometimes called action capsules) are fairly similar to factory capsules,
at least in the sense that they are capsules that return a function.
However, unlike factories, actions aren't designed to create a value (most of the time),
but instead perform some operation (which typically involves some side effects).

Actions are a useful abstraction for *all* functions that are invoked in other capsules or UI,
but especially so for those that rely on the data in some other capsules.

Here's the overused count example, but with an action capsule exposing the increment operation.
<CodeGroup title="Creating Asynchronous Capsules">
  ```dart
  (int, void Function()) countManager(CapsuleHandle use) {
    final (count, setCount) = use.state(0);
    return (count, () => setCount(count + 1));
  }

  // Another good name for the following is "incrementAction"
  void Function() countIncrementor(CapsuleHandle use) => use(countManager).$2;
  ```

  ```rust
  fn count(CapsuleHandle { register, .. }: CapsuleHandle) -> (u32, impl Fn() + Clone + Send + Sync) {
      let (state, set_state) = register(side_effects::state(0));
      let state = *state;
      let increment = move || set_state(state + 1);
      (state, increment)
  }
  
  fn increment(CapsuleHandle { mut get, .. }: CapsuleHandle) -> impl Fn() + Clone + Send + Sync {
      get(count).1
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Practical Example
> Some years ago, I wrote an invoicing/billing application for a financial firm using Rx
> and some other technologies.
> I recently had to update the application and decided it'd be a great test of rearch.
> I created this particular paradigm, amongst several others, during that rewrite.

Take the following (simplified) requirements for a billing application:
1. Load client information, including their assets
2. Generate a pdf of bills to be sent to the clients
3. Download/print those bills
4. Print envelopes to send the bills in
5. Export/display some other information/statistics requested by the firm

Spoiler: every single one of these requirements can be modeled as an action!
(In the actual implementation I wrote,
generating bills/envelopes/statistics were moved into private capsules
outside of the actual actions to enable caching in some situations, which you can see below.)

Here's a (condensed) view of what my implementation looks like for the above requirements.
```dart
// Loading Clients:

/// Action that loads all clients from an Excel file.
void Function() clientLoaderCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  // allClientsManager is a capsule that uses the mutation side effect to load
  // in clients from a user-supplied Excel file.
  return use(allClientsManager).mutate;
}


// Invoicing:

/// Represents the invoices for the clients to bill.
Future<Uint8List> _invoicesCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) => throw 'Impl hidden';

/// Action that prints the invoices.
Future<void> Function() invoicesPrinterCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  final invoices = use(_invoicesCapsule);
  return () => Printing.layoutPdf(onLayout: (_) => invoices);
}

/// Action that downloads the invoices.
Future<void> Function() invoicesDownloaderCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  final invoices = use(_invoicesCapsule);
  final filename = use(_invoicesFilenameCapsule); // another private capsule
  return () async =>
      Printing.sharePdf(bytes: await invoices, filename: filename);
}


// Envelopes:

/// Represents the envelopes for the clients to bill.
Future<Uint8List> _envelopesCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) => throw 'Impl hidden';

/// Action that prints the envelopes.
Future<void> Function() envelopesPrinterCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  final envelopes = use(_envelopesCapsule);
  return () => Printing.layoutPdf(onLayout: (_) => envelopes);
}
```

See how easy it becomes to model an application like the above?
Plus, this paradigm *completely removes code coupling*,
as your UI/other capules will have absolutely no knowledge
of how any of the business logic works and are only given a function to call.
