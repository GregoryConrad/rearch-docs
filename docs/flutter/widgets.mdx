# Widgets
When creating a UI, it makes sense to boil down individual views to their functional requirements:
- displaying certain data/state
- modifying certain data/state
- wrapping around/displaying other views

As such, UI is often described as a *function of state*;
ReArch takes this one step further by classifying UI as a
function of state *and* any side effect(s).

Sound familiar? It's because capsules are also functions of state and side effect(s)!
Just like capsules, you define widgets as functions consuming state and side effect(s).


## Full Example
First, let's define some capsules for use in our widgets.
Capsules can be defined in the same file as widgets, or in completely separate file(s).
```dart title="Defining some capsules"
String _salutationCapsule(CapsuleHandle _) => 'Hello';

(String, void Function(String)) firstNameCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) => use.state('Alice');

String greetingCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  return '${use(_salutationCapsule)} ${use(firstNameCapsule).$1}!';
} 
```

Next, let's use these capsules in a custom widget.
```dart title="Defining a custom widget"
// Check out Unnested!
// ReArch and Unnested are like peanut butter and jelly, as seen here.
@rearchWidget
Widget myAppBody(WidgetHandle use) {
  return Unnest()
      .scaffold(appBar: AppBar(title: Text(use(greetingCapsule))))
      .center()
      .textField(onChanged: use(firstNameCapsule).$2);
}

// ...

MyAppPage(child: const MyAppBody());
```


## Parameters
Any parameters you add to `@rearchWidget` functions
are automatically passed onto the generated widget's constructor, similar to `@factoryCapsule`.
```dart title="Passing custom parameters to a stateful widget"
// Here's a modified version of the above example.
@rearchWidget
Widget greetingWidget(
  WidgetHandle use, {
  required String greeting,
  required Widget child,
}) {
  return Column(children: [
    Text('$greeting, ${use(firstNameCapsule).$1}!'),
    child,
  ]);
}

// ...

const GreetingWidget(
  greeting: 'Hey',
  child: Text('Some child widget'),
);
```

> You can even use `@rearchWidget` to create simple stateless widgets too, without the boilerplate;
Just don't include the `WidgetHandle` parameter!

Here's an example creating a stateless widget with some parameters.
```dart title="Stateless widget with parameters"
@rearchWidget
Widget myTextCard(BuildContext context, {required String title}) {
  return Card(
    child: Text(
      title,
      style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineLarge,
    ),
  );
}
```

<Info>
  Notice how we depended on the `BuildContext` above.
  You can also depend on the widget's `key` too!
</Info>

Finally, here's an example creating a simple reusable widget without any parameters.
```dart title="Stateless widget without parameters"
@rearchWidget
Widget myIcon() {
  return Icon(Icons.clock, color: Colors.purple);
}
```

## The `RearchBuilder`
The `RearchBuilder` enables you to delegate building a widget
to a callback that has access to a `WidgetHandle` and a `BuildContext`.
This can be useful when you want to simply get a new `WidgetHandle` inline with some other widgets
when it might not make sense to make an entirely new widget (just like Flutter's `Builder` itself).
```dart
MyWidget(
  child: RearchBuilder(
    builder: (context, use) {
      return Placeholder();
    },
  ),
);
```
