# Scoping State 
This page is a WIP, but you can use a RearchConsumer in conjunction with InheritedWidget.

Something like the following macro is planned that will kill
all of the RearchConsumer + InheritedWidget boilerplate:

```dart
@inheritedRearchWidget
(int, void Function()) scopedCount(WidgetHandle use) {
  final (count, setCount) = use.state(0);
  return (count, () => setCount(count + 1));
}

const SomeWidget(
  child: ScopedCount(
    child: Builder(
      builder: (context) {
	    final (count, _incrementCount) = ScopedCount.of(context);
		return Text('$count');
      },
    )
  ),
)
```
