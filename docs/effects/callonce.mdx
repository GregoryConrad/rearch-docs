# Call Once Plugin
The call once plugin does exactly as its name describes;
it calls the supplied function once, returns the value from the first invokation,
and never calls the function again (even if it changes between builds).

```dart title="Call once plugin example"
@unstateCapsule
DateTime startUpTime(
  UseCapsulePlugin<DateTime> use,
) {
  // creationTime will always be the time when the capsule was first created,
  // even if startUpTimeCapsule is rebuilt.
  final creationTime = use.callOnce(DateTime.now);
  return creationTime;
}
```
