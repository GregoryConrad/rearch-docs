# Call Once
The call once side effect does exactly as its name describes;
it calls the supplied function once, returns the value from the first invokation,
and never calls the function again (even if it changes between builds).

```dart title="Call once side effect example"
DateTime startUpTimeCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  // creationTime will always be the time when the capsule was first created,
  // even if startUpTimeCapsule was to rebuild.
  final creationTime = use.callonce(DateTime.now);
  return creationTime;
}
```
