# Persist
The persist side effect is an extremely elegant mechanism to handle data persistence,
and I would go as far as to argue that it is the best approach to state persistence
in any Dart/Flutter state management solution available today.
The persist side effect simply:
- Consumes a function to `read()` data
- Consumes a function to `save()` data changes
- Returns the current persisted value, along with the status of the last save

<Info>
  When your database exposes a stream-based API,
  it is sometimes a good choice to use that directly for easier reactivity.
  However, when you only have access to a Future-based API or want more control over state updates,
  the persist side effect is your best bet to handle persistence
  (given you are the only writer to the data in question).
</Info>

The persist side effect is completely database agnostic, so that:
- Your capsule remains highly testable
- You can swap out the database instance/implementation at runtime

Finally, the persist side effect is also highly adaptable, allowing you to use it for:
- [Optimistic state updates](#optimistic-state-updates)
- [Pessimistic state updates](#pessimistic-state-updates)
- [An offline cache](#acting-as-an-offline-cache)
- [Persisting with defaults](#persisting-with-defaults)
- And anything else you can possibly imagine!


## Optimistic State Updates
Optimistic state updates are often useful when you expect database saves to succeed
(like for an on-device datastore).
They work by *optimistically* updating the state of the capsule as soon as a new state is available,
*then* attempting to persist it.
If the persistence fails (i.e., `save()` fails), the current state of the capsule is rolled back.

Here's what this concept looks like with the persist side effect.

```dart title="Optimistic persist example"
(AsyncValue<int>, void Function(int)) persistedCountManager(CapsuleHandle use) {
  final sharedPrefs = use(sharedPrefsCapsule);
  final (nullableCountState, setPersistedCount) = use.persist<int?>(
    read: () async => sharedPrefs.getInt('count'),
    write: (newCount) async => sharedPrefs.setInt('count', newCount!),
  );

  // SharedPrefs returns null if a value hasn't been set before,
  // so we fill in a default here.
  final countState = nullableCountState.map((count) => count ?? 0);

  final (optimisticCount, setOptimisticCount) = use.state<int?>(null);

  void setCount(int newCount) {
    setOptimisticCount(newCount);
    setPersistedCount(newCount);
  }

  return (
    switch (countState) {
      // When we can, stitch in our data optimistically
      AsyncLoading() when optimisticCount != null =>
        AsyncLoading(Some(optimisticCount)),

      // Otherwise, return the data as-is
      _ => countState,
    },
    setCount,
  );
}
```


## Pessimistic State Updates
Pessimistic state updates are more useful when you expect database saves to have
a decent chance of failure (like for some online databases).
They work by *pessimistically* waiting to update a capsule's state until after
it persists successfully, and not before.
Therefore, the capsule's state will *always* be consistent with the persisted state.

Here's what this concept looks like with the persist side effect.

```dart title="Pessimistic persist example"
(AsyncValue<int>, void Function(int)) persistedCountManager(CapsuleHandle use) {
  final sharedPrefs = use(sharedPrefsCapsule);
  final (nullableCountState, setPersistedCount) = use.persist<int?>(
    read: () async => sharedPrefs.getInt('count'),
    write: (newCount) async => sharedPrefs.setInt('count', newCount!),
  );

  // SharedPrefs returns null if a value hasn't been set before,
  // so we fill in a default here.
  final countState = nullableCountState.map((count) => count ?? 0);

  return (countState, setPersistedCount);
}
```


## Acting as an Offline Cache
TODO we need a separate side effect for this, something like:
```dart
final (cache, refreshCache) = use.cache(
  refreshOnFirstBuild: true,
  getLatest: () async => readOnline(),
  readCache: () async => readCache(),
  writeCache: (newCache) async => writeCache(newCache),
);
```

## Persisting With Defaults
> Typically, *it is not a good idea to hide `AsyncValue`s* behind a default value
just because you don't understand how `AsyncValue`s work or don't want to deal with them!
Instead, learn how to embrace `AsyncValue` and your code will improve tenfold.

To persist some state, but also allow consumers of your capsule to only receive synchronous data,
you can create a wrapper capsule around an `AsyncValue` capsule that exposes a default value.
*Wrapping capsules* is a common pattern in rearch, since capsules are designed to be composable!

<Warning>
  You will not be able to know if an error occurs or if the data is still loading
  with this approach, which is why it is often discouraged!
</Warning>

With that warning out of the way, here is a quick example on how to expose a synchronous copy
of some persisted data.

```dart title="Wrapping a persist capsule with a synchronous capsule"
(AsyncValue<int>, void Function(int)) persistedCountManager(CapsuleHandle use) {
  final sharedPrefs = use(sharedPrefsCapsule);
  final (nullableCountState, setPersistedCount) = use.persist<int?>(
    read: () async => sharedPrefs.getInt('count'),
    write: (newCount) async => sharedPrefs.setInt('count', newCount!),
  );

  // SharedPrefs returns null if a value hasn't been set before,
  // so we fill in a default here.
  final countState = nullableCountState.map((count) => count ?? 0);

  return (countState, setPersistedCount);
}

int countCapsule(CapsuleHandle use) {
  const myDefault = 0;
  return use(persistedCountManager).$1.dataOr(myDefault);
}
```
