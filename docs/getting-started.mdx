# Getting Started

<Tabs
  values={[
    { label: 'With Flutter', value: 'flutter' },
    { label: 'Dart Only', value: 'dart' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="flutter">

Simply run:
`flutter pub add unstate flutter_unstate`

And (*this part is important*), wrap your application widget
with an `UnstateBootstrapper` widget in your `main.dart`.
```dart title="main.dart modifications"
void main() {
  runApp(UnstateBootstrapper(
    child: MaterialApp(...),
  ));
}
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="dart">

Simply run:
`dart pub add unstate`

And then just create one container for your application.
```dart title="Creating a capsule container"
void main() {
  final container = CapsuleContainer();
  // Use the container.
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you're all set to follow the rest of the docs!
