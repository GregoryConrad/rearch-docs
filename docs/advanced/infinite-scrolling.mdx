# Infinite Scrolling
Infinite scrolling is relatively easy to do in rearch!
Rearch gives you the flexibility to do it in almost any way you choose,
but here are the two standard ways:
1. Use a factory and let Flutter handle the disposal of out-of-view widgets (preferred).
You can easily customize how long widgets are kept alive with `use.automaticKeepAlive`!
2. Keep your own cache and grow it as the user scrolls (not as recommended).
Whenever new widgets come into view, they add elements to a capsule of type `List<Future<T>>`.

Both approaches described above utilize a more advanced technique
described in [Reducing Builds](/advanced/reducing-builds).

## TODO
Zapp! of both of the above with `/packages/examples/xyz`.
Waiting on https://github.com/invertase/docs.page/pull/278
